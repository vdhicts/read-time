# read-time

Laravel package to determine the read time of a text. 

## Requirements

This package requires at least Laravel 8 and PHP 7.4 or newer.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

`composer require vdhicts/read-time`

## Usage

This package can be used multiple ways. When the content contains HTML, the HTML is stripped before calculating the read
time.

### Helper

The helper returns the amount of minutes (as integer) it should take for the reader to read the text. 

```php
read_time($text);
read_time($text, $wordPerMinute);
```

### Blade

The blade directive returns the amount of minutes (as integer) it should take for the reader to read the text.

```php
@readTime($text)
@readTime($text, $wordPerMinute)
```

### Direct usage

The class offers a bit more functionality.

```php
use Vdhicts\ReadTime\ReadTime;

$readTime = new ReadTime($text);
// OR $readTime = new ReadTime($text, $wordsPerMinute);
$readTime->minutes(); // the amount of minutes (as integer) it should take to read
$readTime->seconds(); // the amount of seconds (as integer) it should take to read
$readTime->wordCount(); // the amount of words (as integer) found in the text
```

### Custom configuration

Publish the configuration with:

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Vdhicts\ReadTime\ReadTimeServiceProvider"`
